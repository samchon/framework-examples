# Examples for Samchon Framework
> ## Deprecated, use TGrid instead
> [**TGrid**](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid) - TypeScript Grid Computing Framework 
> 
> I've developed much better solution for implementing the [OON](https://github.com/samchon/framework#object-oriented-network) by realizing the true Grid Computing through the RFC (Remote Function Call). [**TGrid**](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid) is a new framework for that solution. Therefore, [**TGrid**](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid) will replace the Samchon Frameowrk and continue developing the *OON*.

## TGrid-Exampels
*Samchon Framework* has been deprecated and [TGrid](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid) will replace it. Also, this example repository would be deprecated and replaced to the [tgrid-examples](https://github.com/samchon/tgrid-examples).
